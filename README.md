# RESEARCH EXPERIANCE  
##[Compiler](https://github.com/ayatmarzie/decaf)

| C++ |  Prof. Elham Esmaeeli   |
| --- | --- |
|     |     |

- It has two sections:
   - Lexis Analyzer - also known as scanner.
   - Semantic Analyzer - also known as parser.
- The compiler is for a semi-C language called Decaf. More information is available [here](https://w3.cs.jmu.edu/lam2mo/cs630_2016_01/files/decaf_ref.pdf)
- ersion C++11 or higher is needed to compile this code.  

##Operating Systems

| C++ |  Prof. Elham Esmaeeli   |
| --- | --- |
|     |     |

Three separately projects are available:  
1. [The first project](https://github.com/ayatmarzie/airlinemanager) is a practice for scheduling in operating systems .  
2. [The second project](https://github.com/ayatmarzie/OS_secondproject_senderReciever) is a practice for synchronization in operating systems.  
3. [The third project](https://github.com/ayatmarzie/memorymanagement) is a practice for memory management in operating systems .  
- The first project is a time manager for planes take off. There are several policies manage the priority based on fuel or time.  
- The second project is similar to producer-consumer problem. no QT version of semaphores or other features is used.  
- The third project is for memory management and it can define the address of data in a hard drive, the page fault rates, page table hit, TLB hits.· Version C++11 or higher is needed to compile all the phases of this code.  
- Good libraries has used especially for the second project, which is a practice for multi-thread programming.  

##[computer networks](https://github.com/ayatmarzie/multithreadcommunication)

|python | Prof. M.Alambardar |
| --- | --- |
|     |     |

- A socket programming code which connects two systems and help them to communicate with each
other.
- Multi-threading helps both client and server to chat(send and receive data).
- It only contains one piece of code and by running it on one computer the other computer should connect
it via terminal(Linux).
- Only one computer can be used and the consul log can communicate with the terminal.
- It is two way communication and each of the consul log and terminal can both send and receive data.  

##Artificial Intelligence

|python | Prof. Z.Moslehi |
| --- | --- |
|     |     |

- A solution for [traveling salesman](https://github.com/ayatmarzie/travellingSalesmanGA) problem using genetic algorithm.
- It contains a python file of useful classes and methods like individuals, population, cities, and etc.
- Inputs are: number of population,number of generations and probabilities and adjacency matrix.
- The outputs are the efficient chromosome of all and certain generation and as number of population there
are permutations of cities and for each generation it repeats(the input contain number of generations.).
- Both input and output are sent by files.  

##Data Mining

|python | Prof. Z.Moslehi |
| --- | --- |
|     |     |

It has 3 phases and the first phase which is preprocessing had uploaded into two sections
- The data for train was in an excel file.
- A various machine learning libraries has used likeL panda, pca, yellowbricks, sklearn, boxplot, and etc.
- The discription in details is mentioned in readme in [github](https://github.com/ayatmarzie/data-mining).
